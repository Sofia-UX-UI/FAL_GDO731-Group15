### File Storage / Version Control
We will use Git and GitHub for version control and file storage. This allows us to collaborate efficiently, track changes, and ensure code integrity. 
Each team member will have their own branch for development, with regular merges into the main branch after peer reviews.

We will be saving copies of text documents on git as backups while having live documents hosted on OneDrive/GoogleDocs/Confluence/Notion for collaboration and updates. 
Links to these documents are shared in Discord and recorded on Miro for ease of access.  


### Communication Strategy
Our team values open and honest communication. Our primary communication tool is Discord for instant messaging and quick updates. We use MS Teams and email to contact our supervisor.  

#### Commitment
We expect a 24-hour turnaround time for any questions to be answered during the week. 48 hours on weekends.  
If a member does not respond within the agreed time, an email will be sent to their Falmouth email address. 

#### Meetings
##### Sprint Planning & Review: 
Platform: Discord  
Timing: Fridays 5PM CEST/ 4PM BST / 11AM EDT

We have weekly video meetings with our supervisor Sally to keep her informed, ask for feedback, and gain support.

### Scrum Development 
The team is using Jira for task management, organization, and tracking 

#### "Daily" Check-ins 
We individually post in the Check-in channel at least once per week and members will be directly tagged when feedback or questions surface.  

#### Sprint Planning & Reviews  
Our team uses meetings to review progress and quality and determine next steps and goals for the following week. 
Please see the meeting section for more details around scheduling.  

#### Sprint Retrospectives  
The team hosts regular retrospectives during team meetings to check in and make improvements to workflow.  

### Tools and Techniques
- **Version Control / Code Repository**: GitHub
- **Project Management**: Jira
- **Communication**: Discord, MS Teams, BigBlueButton
- **Design & Development**: Figma, Unity, Miro, Adobe products, 
- **Collaborative Documentation**: OneDrive/Confluence/Miro/Figma 
- **Code Development**: Visual Studio Code


### Processes 
#### Decision Making 
The team uses heart emojis is their colour to vote of things in Miro. Product defining decisions are made as a team. 
Specialty focused decisions are shared with the team and if issues exist a meeting is held to discuss. 

##### Tie Breaking  
Since there are five of us in the team results should avoid ending in a tie. 
If there is a tie we will explore all options, pros and cons, and if there are compromises that can be made.  

##### Conflict Resolution  
Our team values open and honest communication. 
We aim to create a space where we can deal with issues as they surface instead of avoiding and creating larger problems. 
We aim to focus feedback on the project and not on individuals. 
Retrospectives are used to surface ways we can perform better as team.  

##### Team Member Issues  
We aim to resolve team member issues one on one. We lean on the team for support if/when needed. 
If the problem cannot be resolved by the team, we will contact our supervisor for advice and guidance.
